## Classification of Benign and Malignant Breast Cancer Mass using Convolutional Neural Network

DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography) is an open-source dataset of digital mammograms of breast. Recently the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) have published an updated version of DDSM, Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM) [13]. This version includes the ROIs of the origin images, which were segmented by the lesion segmentation algorithm. The dataset of mass outline binary DICOM images, which is the subset of CBIS-DDSM, will be applied in this project.
